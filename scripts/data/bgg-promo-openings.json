Take a Minor with Moon/Fire and Earth - these are more consistently useful than Plant. Place your first presence in a land touching several lands of the same type, preferably the Build land. Consider which ally benefits most from an extra play (slower Spirits) or Minor access (faster Spirits). Noteworthy plays: Bringer - use Primordial Deeps for Moon/Earth to hit max innates, choose Earth for Serpent Rouses level 2. Vital Strength - use Flowing Power for extra play with Growth 3, enables Rituals + Draw of the Fruitful Earth combo. Wildfire - use Flowing Power for Growth 3, play Flash Fires + Asphyxiating Smoke. Lightning - use Flowing Power for Fire, enables Growth 2 + Harbingers + Shatter Homesteads."

Place presence in a land with at least one Town, or touching several Ravage lands. Absorb Essence nets +3 Energy and grants an ally an element they need. Aegis defends your land and all adjacent lands. Hit Serpent Rouses to crush or push a Town (rarely both without setup)."
