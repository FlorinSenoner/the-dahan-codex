| Feature                           | Reason                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Real-time multiplayer sync        | Massive complexity, connectivity issues at game tables |
| Game AI / automation              | Competes with official Handelabra digital app          |
| Card image hosting (v1)           | Load from external source first, bundle in v2          |
| Spirit synergy recommendations    | Requires community data integration                    |
| Multiple languages (i18n)         | English only for v1                                    |
| Board-relative presence placement | Track slots only, not island positions                 |
| Growth option validation          | Trust opening authors, display-only                    |
| Visual regression tests           | Functional E2E sufficient for v1                       |
