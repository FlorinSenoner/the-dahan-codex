# Phase 2.1 Plan 03: Filter Fixes Summary

**WCAG 2.5.5 AAA touch targets (44px) and cursor-pointer on all interactive elements with layout-stable filter chips**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-25T21:40:32Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-25T21:41:53Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (Task 1 already complete from prior work)
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Filter chips now have 44px minimum height touch targets
- Clear all button positioned right with visual divider, preventing layout shift
- Spirit rows and back buttons have explicit cursor-pointer
- Icon-only back buttons have aria-label for accessibility

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Fix filter button and filter pills in filter-sheet.tsx** - Already complete (prior work)
2. **Task 2: Fix filter chips and Clear all layout shift** - `067c6b3` (fix)
3. **Task 3: Add cursor-pointer to spirit rows and back button** - `194347a` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified

- `app/components/spirits/filter-chips.tsx` - Added 44px touch targets, cursor-pointer, layout-stable Clear all
- `app/components/spirits/spirit-row.tsx` - Added cursor-pointer to Link
- `app/routes/spirits.$slug.tsx` - Added 44px touch targets and cursor-pointer to back buttons, aria-label

## Decisions Made

- **Clear all positioning:** Moved to right side with `ml-auto` and `border-l border-border` divider to prevent layout shift when filters are added/removed
- **aria-label on back buttons:** Added `aria-label="Back to spirits"` for accessibility and E2E testing

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. Task 1 was already complete from prior work on filter-sheet.tsx.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Touch target and cursor accessibility complete
- Ready for 02.1-04 (Accessibility and Polish)
- All interactive elements meet WCAG 2.5.5 AAA requirements
