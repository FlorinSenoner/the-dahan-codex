# Phase 2.1 Plan 06: Aspect Title & Description Summary

**Clean aspect titles showing just aspect name, description field display for detailed playstyle info, and verified SSR pattern**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-25T21:43:54Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-25T21:45:16Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Aspect detail pages show clean titles (e.g., "Pandemonium" instead of "Lightning's Swift Strike (Pandemonium)")
- Subtitle correctly shows "Aspect of [Base Spirit Name]" without string manipulation
- Description field displays for spirits that have detailed playstyle text
- Verified SSR query skip pattern is correctly implemented across all Convex queries

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Fix aspect title display** - `2e60d2e` (fix)
2. **Task 2: Add description field display** - `2c030c2` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Verify SSR error resolution** - No code changes (verification only)

## Files Modified

- `app/routes/spirits.$slug.tsx` - Updated displayName logic and added description rendering

## Decisions Made

- **Aspect title display:** Show only the aspect name as the main heading since the subtitle already indicates it's an aspect. This avoids duplicate information.
- **Description styling:** Used `text-foreground/80 text-sm leading-relaxed` for description to differentiate from the summary while maintaining readability.
- **No SSR changes needed:** The existing `isClient + "skip"` pattern is correctly implemented across all Convex queries (spirit-list.tsx, spirits.$slug.tsx, index.tsx).

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - all verification checks passed.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Spirit detail page is polished and ready for UAT verification
- Aspect title display is clean and intuitive
- Description field provides additional context for spirits that have it
- Ready for Phase 3 (Opening Scrubber) which will add Growth/Presence tracks
