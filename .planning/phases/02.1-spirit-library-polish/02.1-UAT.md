## Current Test

number: 7
name: View Transitions Between List and Detail
expected: |
  Navigating from spirit list to spirit detail shows smooth crossfade/morph animation on spirit image. Back navigation also animates.
awaiting: user response

## Tests

### 1. Spirit Images Load Locally
expected: On the spirit list page, River Surges in Sunlight and Lightning's Swift Strike display images loaded from local files (no broken image icons, no external wiki URLs).
result: pass
note: Fixed by reseeding database with .png paths and adding placeholder fallback (commit 4607981)

### 2. Immense Aspect Available
expected: Lightning's Swift Strike shows 4 aspects including "Immense" (from Promo Pack 2). Tapping it navigates to the Immense aspect detail page.
result: pass
note: Fixed by downloading unique aspect images and adding placeholder fallback for aspects without art (commit b26f2df)

### 3. Complexity Modifier Icons
expected: Aspect rows display colored modifier icons next to complexity badge. "Harder" aspects show red up-arrow, "easier" would show green down-arrow.
result: pass
note: Moved indicators inline with names per user feedback (commit 6752793)

### 4. Filter Touch Targets
expected: Filter chips and buttons have at least 44px tap area. Easy to tap on mobile without mis-tapping adjacent elements.
result: pass
note: Reduced chip height with py-1.5 padding per user feedback (commit 5ab2b59)

### 5. Cursor Pointer on Interactives
expected: Spirit rows, filter chips, and back buttons show pointer cursor on hover (desktop).
result: pass
note: User confirmed pass

### 6. Element Colors in Filter Pills
expected: When filter options are selected, they display element-specific colors (Fire=red, Water=blue, etc.) instead of generic highlight.
result: pass

### 7. View Transitions Between List and Detail
expected: Navigating from spirit list to spirit detail shows smooth crossfade/morph animation on spirit image. Back navigation also animates.
result: [pending]

### 8. Aspect Title Display
expected: Aspect detail pages show just the aspect name as heading (e.g., "Pandemonium") with "Aspect of Lightning's Swift Strike" as subtitle below.
result: [pending]

### 9. Spirit Description Field
expected: Spirit detail page shows detailed description/playstyle text below the summary section for spirits that have it.
result: [pending]

### 10. No SSR Hydration Errors
expected: Page loads without console errors about Convex queries or hydration mismatches. Check browser console on initial load.
result: [pending]
