# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 02-spirit-library
    provides: Spirit schema and seed data foundation
provides:
  - complexityModifier field for aspect display (up/down arrows)
  - description field for detailed spirit playstyle text
  - Immense aspect for Lightning's Swift Strike
  - Complete aspect complexity modifier data
  - reseedSpirits mutation for data refresh
affects: [02.1-02, aspect-detail-ui, filtering-ui]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:

  patterns:
    - "Aspect complexityModifier for relative complexity display"
    - "reseed mutation pattern for idempotent data refresh"

key-files:

  modified:
    - convex/schema.ts
    - convex/seed.ts

key-decisions:
  - "Aspects inherit base complexity (Low) - complexityModifier is display-only"
  - "All current aspects are 'harder' than base spirits"
  - "reseedSpirits mutation duplicates seed logic (can't call mutations from mutations)"

patterns-established:
  - "complexityModifier: easier/same/harder for aspect complexity indication"
  - "description field for detailed playstyle text on spirit detail pages"

# Phase 2.1 Plan 01: Schema and Seed Data Update Summary

**Added complexityModifier and description fields to spirit schema, Immense aspect for Lightning, and all aspect complexity modifiers**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-25T22:11:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-25T22:15:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Schema extended with complexityModifier (easier/same/harder) and description fields
- Immense aspect added for Lightning's Swift Strike (from Promo Pack 2)
- All 7 aspects now have complexityModifier: "harder"
- Base spirits have detailed description text for detail pages
- reseedSpirits mutation for refreshing database data

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add complexityModifier and description fields to schema** - `8506c07` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Add Immense aspect and fix all aspect data** - `dd940d3` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Create reseed mutation and run it** - `a07e5ec` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `convex/schema.ts` - Added complexityModifier and description optional fields
- `convex/seed.ts` - Added Promo Pack 2 expansion, Immense aspect, complexity modifiers, descriptions, and reseedSpirits mutation

## Decisions Made
- Aspects keep base complexity field (Low) matching the base spirit - the complexityModifier is for display arrows, not filtering
- All current aspects are "harder" than their base spirits
- Added Promo Pack 2 expansion (releaseYear: 2021) for Immense aspect
- reseedSpirits mutation duplicates seed logic since Convex mutations can't call other mutations

## Deviations from Plan
None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Schema ready for UI to display complexity modifier arrows
- Description field available for spirit detail pages
- Database populated with complete aspect data including Immense
