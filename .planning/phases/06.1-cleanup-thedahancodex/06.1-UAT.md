## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Raw Buttons Fixed (Gap Closure)
expected: All raw <button> elements replaced with shadcn Button. Filter chips, install prompt, filter sheet all use Button component. Verify visually that buttons look consistent.
result: issue
reported: "Clear all button missing rounded corners (had rounded-none), filter pills missing cursor-pointer for desktop hover. Also needs CLAUDE.md documentation about mobile-first with desktop support."
severity: minor
fixed_in_session: true

### 2. Update Banner Fixed (Gap Closure)
expected: Update banner is now a clickable pill in bottom-right (bottom-20 right-4), entire pill clickable, neutral zinc styling (no green). To test: trigger SW update or view in Storybook/isolation.
result: issue
reported: "Missing cursor-pointer on hover. Text becomes unreadable on hover (zinc-300 text on zinc-700 background)."
severity: minor
fixed_in_session: true

### 3. Dead Code Removed
expected: No abandoned Phase 3.4 files exist (power-dsl.ts, element icons directory deleted). App loads without missing import errors.
result: pass
note: Verified via automated check - files confirmed deleted

### 4. SSR Directives Removed
expected: UI components no longer have "use client" directives (meaningless in client-side SPA). drawer.tsx, tooltip.tsx, accordion.tsx have no "use client".
result: pass
note: Verified via automated check - no "use client" found

### 5. CLAUDE.md Documentation
expected: CLAUDE.md describes "text-based turn-by-turn opening guides" and documents Button component usage pattern (always use shadcn Button, not raw button).
result: pass
