- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files deleted:** 12
- **Files modified:** 8

## Accomplishments

1. **Task 1: Remove dead code files** - `fdd8c4d` (chore)
2. **Task 2: Clean spirit-colors.ts unused exports** - `9f35652` (chore)
3. **Task 3: Remove "use client" directives** - `cb71dc2` (chore)

## Files Deleted
- `app/lib/power-dsl.ts` - Abandoned Phase 3.4 power DSL parser
- `app/components/icons/elements/sun.tsx` - Unused element icon
- `app/components/icons/elements/moon.tsx` - Unused element icon
- `app/components/icons/elements/fire.tsx` - Unused element icon
- `app/components/icons/elements/air.tsx` - Unused element icon
- `app/components/icons/elements/water.tsx` - Unused element icon
- `app/components/icons/elements/earth.tsx` - Unused element icon
- `app/components/icons/elements/plant.tsx` - Unused element icon
- `app/components/icons/elements/animal.tsx` - Unused element icon
- `app/components/icons/elements/any.tsx` - Unused element icon
- `app/components/icons/elements/star.tsx` - Unused element icon
- `app/components/icons/elements/index.ts` - Barrel export for deleted icons

## Files Modified
- `app/lib/spirit-colors.ts` - Removed spiritTrackColors, trackGradientClasses, getSpiritTrackColors
- `app/components/ui/drawer.tsx` - Removed "use client" directive
- `app/components/ui/radio-group.tsx` - Removed "use client" directive
- `app/components/ui/select.tsx` - Removed "use client" directive

- `app/components/ui/popover.tsx` - Removed "use client" directive
- `app/components/ui/accordion.tsx` - Removed "use client" directive
- `app/components/ui/label.tsx` - Removed "use client" directive

## Decisions Made
- Removed unused spirit track color exports that were leftover from abandoned board visualization feature
- "use client" directives have no effect in Vite + React client-side SPA (no SSR), so removed them

## Deviations from Plan
None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Codebase is cleaner with ~650 lines of dead code removed
- knip shows 3 configuration hints for further cleanup (papaparse, entry pattern)
- Ready for additional cleanup phases if needed
