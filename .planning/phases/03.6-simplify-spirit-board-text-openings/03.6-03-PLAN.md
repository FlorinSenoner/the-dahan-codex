  <name>Task 1: Remove board section test and update assertions</name>
  <files>e2e/spirits.spec.ts</files>
  <action>
In `e2e/spirits.spec.ts`:

1. DELETE the entire test "spirit detail shows board sections" (lines ~150-169):
```typescript
test("spirit detail shows board sections", async ({ page }) => {
  // ... entire test block
});
```

2. KEEP the test "spirit detail shows overview section" (lines ~133-148) - it verifies Strengths/Weaknesses headings which we're keeping.

3. KEEP the test "spirit detail shows external links" (lines ~171-189) - External links are still shown.

4. KEEP all other tests - they test:
   - Spirit list rendering
   - Filter functionality
   - Navigation to detail page
   - Bottom navigation
   - Credits page
   - Variant tabs
   - Variant tab navigation

The test file should have 9 tests after removing the board sections test.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `pnpm build` first (E2E tests need built app)
Run `pnpm test:e2e` - all tests should pass
  </verify>
  <done>E2E tests pass, no assertions for Growth/Presence/Innate/Cards sections</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `pnpm test:e2e` passes (all 9 tests)
2. No test references "Growth", "Presence Tracks", "Innate Powers", or "Starting Cards"
3. Spirit detail tests verify overview and external links sections
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Board sections test removed
- All remaining E2E tests pass
- Test count is 9 (down from 10)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03.6-simplify-spirit-board-text-openings/03.6-03-SUMMARY.md`
