# Phase 3.6 Plan 02: Clean Schema and Seed Data Summary

**One-liner:** Verified schema and seed data cleanup - board fields (growth, presenceTracks, innates, uniquePowers) already removed in 03.6-01

## Changes Made

The work specified in this plan was largely already completed in Plan 03.6-01 (Delete Board Components). This plan verified the cleanup and made minor comment removals.

### Task 1: Remove board fields from schema.ts

**Status:** Already completed in 03.6-01

The schema was already cleaned to 67 lines (from ~270) with these fields removed:
- elementValidator const
- growth field (growth options DSL)
- presenceTracks field (graph/legacy formats)
- innates field (innate power definitions)
- uniquePowers field (unique power card definitions)

### Task 2: Remove board data from seed.ts

**Status:** Already completed in 03.6-01

The seed data was already cleaned to ~773 lines (from ~3070) with board-related fields removed from all 13 spirit entries (6 base + 7 aspects).

This commit removed remaining mechanic comments:
- "Unique mechanic: Choose-from-four growth with OR options"
- "Unique mechanic: 6 presence tracks, 4 unlock growth choices"
- "Unique mechanic: Branching presence tracks with bidirectional traversal"
- "Unique mechanic: Deep Slumber presence limit track (5-13)"

## Files Modified

| File | Lines | Change |
|------|-------|--------|
| convex/schema.ts | 67 | Verified clean (unchanged) |
| convex/seed.ts | 772 | Removed 4 comment lines |

## Verification

1. `pnpm typecheck` - PASS
2. Schema line count: 67 lines (target: ~100)
3. No growth, presenceTracks, innates, uniquePowers fields in schema - VERIFIED
4. No board data in seed entries - VERIFIED

## Deviations from Plan

### Already Completed Work

**Observation:** Plan 03.6-01 was more comprehensive than planned - it cleaned both the components AND the schema/seed data. This made Plan 03.6-02 largely a verification exercise.

**Impact:** Minimal - the work needed to be done regardless of which plan accomplished it.
