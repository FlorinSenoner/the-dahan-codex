# Phase 3.6 Plan 7: Spirit Detail Integration Summary

**OpeningSection integrated into spirit detail page, displaying turn-by-turn opening guides between special rules and external links**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-28T14:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-28T14:03:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Integrated OpeningSection component into spirit detail page
- Verified page structure: image, name, badges, summary, overview, special rules, openings, external links
- Confirmed no remnants of old board visualization components (GrowthPanel, PresenceTrack, InnatePowers, CardHand)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add OpeningSection to spirit detail page** - `66bb5f0` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Verify full integration** - No commit (verification only)

**Plan metadata:** See final commit below

## Files Created/Modified

- `app/routes/spirits.$slug.tsx` - Added OpeningSection import and render between SpecialRules and ExternalLinks

## Decisions Made

- OpeningSection placed between SpecialRules and ExternalLinks - follows logical flow from rules to guides to external resources
- No conditional wrapper needed around OpeningSection since it handles its own loading and empty states

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 3.6 complete - spirit detail page now shows text-based openings
- River spirit has sample opening data with 3 turns
- Future phases can add more spirit openings and admin tools for managing openings
