# Phase 3.6 Plan 5: Sample Opening Seed Data Summary

**River Surges in Sunlight sample opening with 3 turn-by-turn instructions demonstrating text-based opening guide format**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-28T12:15:41Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-28T12:18:41Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Added "Standard Opening" for River with 3 turns of step-by-step instructions
- Each turn includes title, instructions, and notes for context
- Updated reseedSpirits to properly clean up and reseed openings data
- Attribution to Spirit Island Community FAQ

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add sample opening for River Surges in Sunlight** - `79cf457` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `convex/seed.ts` - Added openings insert to seedSpirits and reseedSpirits mutations
- `convex/_generated/api.d.ts` - Auto-generated API types (openings module reference)

## Decisions Made

- Opening structure follows plan exactly: spiritId reference, slug, name, description, difficulty, turns array
- Attribution to Spirit Island Community FAQ with source URL
- reseedSpirits deletes openings before spirits to respect foreign key constraints

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Sample opening data available for testing frontend components
- listBySpirit and getBySlug queries from 03.6-04 can now return real data
- Ready for 03.6-06 (frontend integration) and 03.6-07 (additional spirits)
