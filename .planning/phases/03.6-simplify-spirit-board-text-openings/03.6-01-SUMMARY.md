# Phase 3.6 Plan 01: Remove Board Visualization Components Summary

Removed graphical board visualization components and seed data in preparation for text-based opening guides.

## What Was Done

### Task 1: Remove board component imports from route files
- Removed imports for CardHand, GrowthPanel, InnatePowers, PresenceTrack from spirits.$slug.tsx
- Removed JSX rendering of growth, presence, innates, and cards sections
- Spirit detail now shows: image, name, badges, overview, special rules, external links
- Commit: `6707b7d`

### Task 2: Delete board component files
- Deleted 7 board component files (growth-panel, presence-track, graph-presence-track, presence-node, edge-overlay, innate-powers, card-hand)
- Cleaned up convex/seed.ts to remove growth, presenceTracks, innates, uniquePowers data
- Reduced seed.ts from 3068 lines to 776 lines
- Commit: `627d55a`

### Task 3: Delete growth icon files
- Deleted entire app/components/icons/growth/ directory (5 files)
- Element icons preserved in elements/ for badges and filters
- Commit: `e53505c`

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] seed.ts cleanup required for TypeScript compilation**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** Schema was already simplified but seed.ts still contained growth/presenceTracks/innates/uniquePowers data, causing TypeScript errors
- **Fix:** Rewrote seed.ts removing all board-related fields while preserving spirit metadata
- **Files modified:** convex/seed.ts
- **Commit:** 627d55a

## Verification Results

- `pnpm typecheck` passes with no errors
- `pnpm build` completes successfully (926.73 kB JS, 77.43 kB CSS)
- Spirit detail page displays: image, name, badges, overview, special rules, external links
- No Growth, Presence Tracks, Innate Powers, or Cards sections

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `app/routes/spirits.$slug.tsx` - Removed board component imports and JSX
- `convex/seed.ts` - Removed board data fields from all spirits

**Deleted (12 files total):**
- 7 board components in app/components/spirits/
- 5 growth icons in app/components/icons/growth/

## Lines of Code

- Removed: ~3,878 lines
- Spirit components remaining: 9 (external-links, filter-chips, filter-sheet, overview-section, power-radar-chart, special-rules, spirit-list, spirit-row, variant-tabs)

## Next Phase Readiness

Ready for Plan 02: Add text-based opening schema and UI
- Spirit detail page is clean and ready for openings section
- Database schema can be extended with openings table
- No blocking issues
