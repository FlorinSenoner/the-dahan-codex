# Phase 03.6 Plan 08: UAT Gap Closure Summary

**Verified SpecialRules removal, sourceUrl fix, and aspect openings isolation - all UAT gaps already closed**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1.4 min (84 seconds)
- **Started:** 2026-01-28T21:12:39Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-28T21:14:03Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 0 (all work previously completed)

## Accomplishments
- Verified SpecialRules component and schema field already removed from codebase
- Confirmed opening sourceUrl already fixed (no broken fragment URLs)
- Verified aspect openings isolation architecture correct (spiritId exact match)
- Database reseeded with clean data (no specialRules, working sourceUrl)
- Design comment already present documenting aspect isolation pattern

## Task Commits

All work was previously completed. This execution verified and documented:

**Plan documentation:** `b5c6528` (docs: complete UAT gap closure plan)

## Files Created/Modified
- `app/components/spirits/opening-section.tsx` - Design comment already present at line 14-15

## Decisions Made
- Aspect openings isolation pattern already implemented: Each spirit (base or aspect) queries openings by its own `_id`, aspects never inherit from base
- Architecture verified as correct: aspect pages load their own document, OpeningSection receives spiritId prop, query does exact match
- Design comment already present documenting the pattern

## Deviations from Plan
None - all gap closures were already completed in prior work. This plan served as verification and documentation of UAT fixes.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Phase 3.6 is fully complete with all UAT gaps closed
- Spirit detail page is clean: image, name, badges, summary, overview, openings, external links
- Ready for Phase 5 (Text Opening Management) or other future phases
