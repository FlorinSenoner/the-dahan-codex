## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Minimalist Tab Styling

expected: Visit a spirit with aspects (e.g., River Surges in Sunlight). Active
tab has flat border-b-2 underline, no gradient background. result: pass

### 2. Scroll-Aware Header Aspect Name

expected: On a spirit detail page with aspects, scroll down past the tabs. The
sticky header should show the current aspect name as a subtitle when the tabs
are no longer visible. result: issue reported: "this works, but the tabs still
scroll on top of the header with the spirit name. make it scroll behind. e.g.
position: relative with z-index 0 would do the trick" severity: minor

### 3. Conditional Tab Rendering

expected: Visit a spirit WITHOUT aspects (e.g., one of the new complex spirits
like Fractured Days). No variant tabs should appear since there are no aspects
to switch between. result: skipped reason: Complex spirits not seeded yet - need
to run npx convex run seed:reseedSpirits

### 4. Pills Below Spirit Name

expected: On any spirit detail page, complexity badge (e.g., "Moderate") and
element badges (Sun, Water, etc.) appear directly below the spirit name, always
visible (not hidden in collapsible). result: pass

### 5. Description in Collapsible Overview

expected: Spirit description text appears inside the collapsible "Overview"
section, not floating above. Expand Overview to see complexity,
strengths/weaknesses, and the description. result: pass

### 6. Growth Panel CSS Subgrid Equal Heights

expected: Visit River Surges in Sunlight. Growth options (G1, G2) display as
cards with equal heights, properly aligned even if they have different amounts
of content. result: issue reported: "you only used the subgrid to render the
hidden g1, g2, g3 - revealed on hover. this is not ideal revert to how g1, g2,
g3 was displayed before. this just makes the grow option unnccessarilly tall and
there is too much whie space. (remove the subgrid if not needed)" severity:
major

### 7. Growth Panel Tooltips

expected: Hover over a growth action icon (e.g., +1 Energy, Gain Card). A
tooltip should appear showing the full action description. result: issue
reported: "this works but would be nice if there was a small hover effect on the
card and the action (e.g slight background change on the card - as in other
places, and slight color change on the action)" severity: cosmetic

### 8. Growth Panel Neutral Icons

expected: Growth action icons use neutral gray color (text-muted-foreground),
not element-specific colors. result: pass

### 9. G1/G2/G3 Labels on Hover

expected: Growth option labels (G1, G2, G3) are hidden by default but appear
when hovering over the growth panel cards. result: issue reported: "the hover
should not appear on the top right of the card. add a slight frosty blur effect
on the card so the g1, g2, g3 is readable" severity: cosmetic

### 10. Spirit-Specific Presence Track Colors

expected: River's presence tracks use cyan/amber gradient. Lightning's use
orange/violet. Each spirit has its own identity colors derived from
primary/secondary elements. result: issue
reported: "nope. you might want to check the data in convex and verify it has the correct values"
severity: major

### 11. Collapsible Cards Section with Count Badge

expected: Cards section shows "Hand" with a count badge (e.g., "Hand (4)"). The
section is collapsible. Cards display in a grid layout (2 columns on desktop).
result: issue
reported: "for the accordion use the same component as used for the overview. remember: no duplication when it comes to component with the same behaviour"
severity: minor

### 12. Card Speed Border-Only Indicator

expected: Power cards show Fast/Slow via left border color only (amber=Fast,
blue=Slow). No text badge saying "Fast" or "Slow". result: issue
reported: "this needs re-work. the cards and Innate Powers should follow the same styling. the border should not only be on the left but rather all around (thin modern border look). then on hover make sure that the border color becomes a bit more prominent and the cord becomes a slight blue/red color based on the speed of the card. also the card of the innate power needs to be collapsable and is collapsed by default"
severity: major

### 13. Innate Powers Border-Only Speed

expected: Innate powers use border-l-4 for speed indication (amber=Fast,
blue=Slow), matching the card styling. No Fast/Slow badge text. result: issue
reported: "covered by test 12 feedback - same styling rework needed"
severity: major

### 14. Innate Powers Single-Line Threshold Layout

expected: Each innate threshold level shows element icons and effect text on the
same line (with wrapping if needed), not stacked vertically. result: pass

### 15. Fractured Days Renders Correctly

expected: Navigate to Fractured Days Split the Sky
(/spirits/fractured-days-split-the-sky). Spirit loads with growth panel showing
OR-style choices (choose from multiple options). result: skipped
reason: No data seeded - need to get data from wiki links and run seed

### 16. Starlight Renders Correctly

expected: Navigate to Starlight Seeks Its Form
(/spirits/starlight-seeks-its-form). Spirit loads with 6 presence tracks showing
growth unlock indicators. result: skipped
reason: No data seeded - same as test 15

### 17. Finder Renders Correctly

expected: Navigate to Finder of Paths Unseen (/spirits/finder-of-paths-unseen).
Spirit loads with presence tracks showing connection indicators (branching
icon). result: skipped
reason: No data seeded - same as test 15

### 18. Serpent Renders Correctly

expected: Navigate to Serpent Slumbering Beneath the Island
(/spirits/serpent-slumbering-beneath-the-island). Spirit loads with Deep Slumber
presence track showing presence cap values. result: skipped
reason: No data seeded - same as test 15
