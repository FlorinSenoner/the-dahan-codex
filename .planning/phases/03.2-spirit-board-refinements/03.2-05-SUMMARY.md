# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 03.2-01
    provides: foundation with element icons and spirit track colors
  - phase: 03.1-06
    provides: initial innate powers component with element icons
provides:
  - Border-only speed indicators for innate powers (no badge text)
  - Single-line element+effect threshold layout
  - Inline Range/Target in power header
affects: [spirit-detail, visual-consistency]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "border-l-4 for speed indication (amber=Fast, blue=Slow)"
    - "Single-line threshold: elements + effect with flex-wrap"

key-files:
  created: []
  modified:
    - app/components/spirits/innate-powers.tsx

key-decisions:
  - "Border-l-4 with amber/blue matches card styling pattern"
  - "No accordion - innate powers always visible"
  - "Threshold separators use border-t with reduced opacity"

patterns-established:
  - "Speed indication via left border color (consistent with cards)"
  - "Inline metadata in headers (Name, Range, Target)"

# Phase 3.2 Plan 05: Innate Powers Border-Only Speed Summary

**Border-only speed indicators for innate powers using border-l-4 (amber=Fast, blue=Slow) with single-line element+effect threshold layout**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-26T23:31:37Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-26T23:34:50Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Removed Fast/Slow badge text, using border-l-4 for speed indication
- Combined element icons and effect text on single line with graceful wrapping
- Moved Range and Target to power header inline with name
- Added subtle border separators between threshold levels
- Removed accordion in favor of always-visible innate powers

## Task Commits

Work was already completed in a parallel execution:

1. **Task 1: Update innate powers with border-only speed** - `83578a5` (feat: 03.2-03 commit included these changes)
2. **Task 2: Verify visual consistency** - Verification only (no changes needed)

Note: The innate powers changes were bundled with the growth panel CSS subgrid commit (83578a5) in a parallel execution. All verification criteria pass.

## Files Modified

- `app/components/spirits/innate-powers.tsx` - Border-l-4 speed styling, single-line thresholds, removed accordion

## Decisions Made

- **Border-l-4 pattern:** Matches card styling with amber (Fast) and blue (Slow) left borders
- **No accordion:** Innate powers are always visible instead of collapsible - reduces clicks and shows all content immediately
- **Threshold separators:** Using `border-t border-border/30` between threshold levels for subtle visual separation without heavy borders

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. Work was completed in a parallel execution.

## Issues Encountered

- **Parallel execution overlap:** The innate powers changes were already committed in 83578a5 (labeled as 03.2-03) along with growth panel changes. This plan verified the changes met all criteria rather than creating a duplicate commit.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Innate powers now visually consistent with card speed styling
- Both use amber/blue color scheme for Fast/Slow indication
- Ready for E2E tests to verify rendering
