## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Tabs Scroll Behind Header
expected: Visit a spirit with aspects (e.g., River). Scroll down. Tabs scroll BEHIND the sticky header (not on top).
result: pass

### 2. Spirit-Specific Presence Track Colors
expected: River shows cyan/amber presence track gradients. Lightning shows orange/violet. Each spirit's tracks reflect their elemental identity.
result: pass
action: "Phase 3.3 needed - redesign presence track DSL to support branching/connected tracks (Finder, Starlight, Serpent patterns)"

### 3. Growth Panel Compact Layout
expected: Growth options display without excessive vertical whitespace. Cards are compact with content close together.
result: issue
reported: "G1/G2/G3 badges should only show on hover, positioned absolute in top right - this would allow cards to be even more compact"
severity: cosmetic

### 4. G1/G2/G3 Labels Always Visible
expected: Growth option labels (G1, G2, G3) are always visible (not hover-reveal) with a subtle frosty blur background effect.
result: issue
reported: "Labels should be hover-only (not always visible), but readable when shown via frosty blur effect"
severity: cosmetic
note: "Same fix as test 3 - hover-only with backdrop-blur for readability"

### 5. Growth Card Hover Effects
expected: Hovering over a growth card shows subtle background color change. Hovering over action icons changes their color.
result: pass

### 6. Cards Full Border Styling
expected: Power cards have thin border all around (not just left border). Border color indicates speed (amber=Fast, blue=Slow).
result: pass

### 7. Cards Hover Effects
expected: Hovering over a power card makes the border more prominent and adds a subtle background tint matching the speed color.
result: pass

### 8. Hand Accordion Matches Overview
expected: The "Hand" collapsible section uses the same styling as the Overview accordion (bg-muted/30, chevron icon on right).
result: pass

### 9. Innate Powers Collapsible
expected: Each innate power is wrapped in a collapsible section that is COLLAPSED by default. Clicking expands to show thresholds.
result: pass
