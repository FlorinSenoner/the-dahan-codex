# Phase 3.2 Plan 08: Growth Panel Layout Summary

**Compact growth cards with inline G1/G2/G3 labels, frosty blur effect, and hover states on cards and action icons**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-27T07:56:36Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-27T07:57:29Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Removed subgrid layout that caused excessive vertical whitespace
- G1/G2/G3 labels now always visible with frosty blur background
- Growth cards have hover:bg-muted/50 effect
- Action icons have hover:text-foreground color transition

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Remove subgrid and add inline G1/G2/G3 labels with hover effects** - `359a06c` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified

- `app/components/spirits/growth-panel.tsx` - Simplified layout without subgrid, inline labels with backdrop-blur

## Decisions Made

- Removed subgrid layout (row-span-2 grid-rows-subgrid) - it caused excessive vertical whitespace between cards
- G1/G2/G3 labels positioned inline at start of flex row instead of hover-reveal in separate row
- Used backdrop-blur-sm for subtle frosty glass effect on labels
- Added transition-colors to both card backgrounds and icon colors for smooth hover feedback

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Growth panel now displays compactly without excessive whitespace
- UAT tests 6, 7, 9 addressed: subgrid whitespace, hover effects, label positioning
