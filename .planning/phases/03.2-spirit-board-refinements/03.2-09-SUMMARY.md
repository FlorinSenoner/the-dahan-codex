# Phase 03.2 Plan 09: Card Speed Border Styling Summary

**Full border styling with hover effects for cards and innate powers, collapsible innates defaulting to closed**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-27T09:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-27T09:08:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Cards display with thin full border (not border-l-4) with speed-based colors
- Innate powers wrapped in Collapsible with defaultOpen={false}
- Hover effects: increased border prominence + subtle background tint
- Hand accordion trigger matches Overview styling

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update cards with full border and matching accordion** - `b0dedfa` (fix) - Already completed in prior plan execution 03.2-10
2. **Task 2: Update innate powers with full border, hover, and collapsible** - `f86ec7e` (feat)

_Note: Task 1 was already implemented in commit b0dedfa as part of plan 03.2-10. This gap closure plan only needed to execute Task 2._

## Files Created/Modified
- `app/components/spirits/card-hand.tsx` - Full border, hover effects, matching accordion (completed in prior commit)
- `app/components/spirits/innate-powers.tsx` - Full border, hover effects, Collapsible wrapper with defaultOpen={false}

## Decisions Made
- Innate powers collapsed by default - reduces visual clutter, user can expand to see thresholds
- ChevronDown icon on right side with rotate-180 on open state
- Matching trigger styling: py-3 px-4 bg-muted/30 rounded-lg min-h-[44px]

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed as written. Task 1 was already completed in a prior plan execution (03.2-10), so only Task 2 was executed.

## Issues Encountered

None - execution proceeded smoothly.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Cards and innate powers have consistent modern styling
- Hover effects provide clear interactive feedback
- Collapsible innates reduce initial visual density
- Ready for UAT re-testing of tests 11, 12, 13
