# Phase 3.2 Plan 03: Growth Panel Redesign Summary

**CSS subgrid layout with neutral icons, modifier-only text, and hover tooltips for cleaner growth panel display**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-26T23:31:44Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-26T23:33:54Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Implemented CSS subgrid for equal-height growth option cards
- Added tooltips showing full action descriptions on hover
- Changed icons to neutral muted-foreground color (from element colors)
- Reduced text noise by showing only modifiers (+2, R1, Major) instead of full descriptions
- Added G1/G2/G3 labels that appear on hover with opacity transition
- Prepared orActions and repeat patterns for complex spirits

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Implement CSS subgrid layout with tooltips** - `83578a5` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Test and verify growth panel rendering** - `32ee8a6` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified

- `app/components/spirits/growth-panel.tsx` - Redesigned with CSS subgrid, tooltips, neutral icons, and complex spirit pattern support

## Decisions Made

- **Icons use text-muted-foreground:** Neutral gray color instead of element-specific colors for cleaner look
- **Modifiers only in text:** Show "+2", "R1", "Major" next to icons; full descriptions in tooltips
- **Group hover pattern:** G1/G2/G3 labels hidden by default, revealed on card hover with opacity transition
- **OR separator styling:** Amber color uppercase "or" text between action choices

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- Lint warning about non-null assertion (!) on orActions - fixed by using inline conditional check instead of separate variable

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Growth panel ready for complex spirits (orActions, repeat patterns supported)
- Visual design cleaner with less text noise
- Ready for E2E tests in Plan 04
