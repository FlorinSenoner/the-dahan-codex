# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "ElementIcon dynamic lookup for element rendering"
    - "PowerHeader reusable component for speed/range/target display"
    - "Speed-based border coloring (amber=Fast, blue=Slow)"

key-decisions:
  - "Element icons render as number + icon pairs (e.g., '2 Sun' becomes '2 <SunIcon>')"
  - "Cards use div with border-2 instead of shadcn Card for simpler styling"
  - "Range/Target display uses abbreviated format (R: / T:) for cards, full format for innates"

# Phase 3.1 Plan 06: Innate Powers & Cards Redesign Summary

**Innate powers and cards now use SVG element icons with consistent speed-based styling and shared ElementIcon DSL**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-26T00:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-26T00:05:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Innate powers display element thresholds with SVG icons instead of text badges
- PowerHeader component shows speed/range/target in horizontal layout
- Cards section renamed from "Starting Cards" to "Cards"
- Cards have speed-based border outlines (amber for Fast, blue for Slow)
- Cards display element SVG icons instead of text badges
- Shared element display DSL via ElementIcon import in both components

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update Innate Powers with Element Icons** - `ffb0bf9` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Update Card Hand with Speed-Based Outlines** - `d9669e6` (feat)

_Note: Task 2 was bundled with another plan's commit (03.1-05) due to pre-commit hook timing._

## Files Created/Modified

- `app/components/spirits/innate-powers.tsx` - Added ElementIcon import, PowerHeader component, SVG element icons in thresholds
- `app/components/spirits/card-hand.tsx` - Renamed section, added speed-based borders, SVG element icons, range/target display

## Decisions Made

- **Element icon display format:** Number followed by icon (e.g., "2" + SunIcon) rather than icon with badge - cleaner look for threshold display
- **Card component simplification:** Replaced shadcn Card with plain div + border-2 for simpler speed-based border styling
- **Range/Target format:** Cards use abbreviated "R:" and "T:" format while innates use full "Range:" and "Target:" labels

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- **Pre-commit hook bundling:** Task 2 changes were bundled with plan 03.1-05's commit (d9669e6) due to pre-commit hook picking up staged files during a failed commit attempt. The code changes are correct and complete.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Innate powers and cards sections now use shared ElementIcon DSL
- Speed/range/target display consistent between innate powers and cards
- Ready for external links polishing (plan 03.1-07)
