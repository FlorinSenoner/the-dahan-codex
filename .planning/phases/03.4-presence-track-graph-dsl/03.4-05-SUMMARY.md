provides:
  - Verification that simple spirits use correct Node-Edge Graph format
  - Documentation of data format for River, Lightning, Fractured Days

# Phase 3.4 Plan 05: Seed Data Conversion Summary

**Verified River, Lightning, and Fractured Days already use Node-Edge Graph format from 03.4-01 conversion**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-27T12:53:15Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-27T12:54:30Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (verified, not modified)
- **Files modified:** 0

## Accomplishments

- Verified River Surges in Sunlight uses Node-Edge Graph format (14 nodes, 0 edges)
- Verified Lightning's Swift Strike uses Node-Edge Graph format (12 nodes, 0 edges)
- Verified Fractured Days Split the Sky uses Node-Edge Graph format (12 nodes, 0 edges)
- Confirmed TypeScript compilation passes

## Task Commits

No commits required - seed data was already converted in 03.4-01.

**Verification results:**

1. **Task 1: Convert River Surges in Sunlight** - Already complete
   - rows: 2, cols: 7
   - 7 energy nodes (e0-e6): 1,2,2,3,4,4,5
   - 7 cardPlays nodes (c0-c6): 1,2,2,3,3(R),4,5
   - edges: [] (linear track)

2. **Task 2: Convert Lightning's Swift Strike** - Already complete
   - rows: 2, cols: 7
   - 7 energy nodes (e0-e6): 1,2,3,4,4,5,6
   - 5 cardPlays nodes (c0-c4): 1,2,2,3,4
   - edges: [] (linear track)

3. **Task 3: Convert Fractured Days** - Already complete
   - rows: 2, cols: 6
   - 6 energy nodes (e0-e5): 1,2,2,3,4,5
   - 6 cardPlays nodes (c0-c5): 1,2,2,3(R),4,5
   - edges: [] (linear track)

## Files Created/Modified

None - all seed data was converted in 03.4-01.

## Decisions Made

None - verified existing implementation.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed as verification of already-complete work.

**Context:** The 03.4-01 SUMMARY.md documents that seed data conversion was pulled forward as a Rule 3 (Blocking) deviation because typecheck could not pass without updating seed.ts to match the new schema. This plan verified that work was done correctly.

## Issues Encountered

None - all spirits already had correct Node-Edge Graph format.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- All simple spirits verified with correct Node-Edge Graph format
- Plan 06 can proceed with complex spirit verification (Finder, Serpent, Starlight)
- Plan 07 can perform comprehensive visual testing
