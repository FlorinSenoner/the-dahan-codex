# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 03.4-01
    provides: Node-Edge Graph schema and initial seed data conversion
  - phase: 03.4-04
    provides: PresenceTrack wiring to GraphPresenceTrack
provides:
  - Verification that complex spirits use Node-Edge Graph format
  - Confirmation of unlocksGrowth, bidirectional, presenceCap metadata

# Phase 3.4 Plan 06: Complex Spirit Testing Summary

**Verified all complex spirits (Starlight, Finder, Serpent) already use Node-Edge Graph format with correct metadata from 03.4-01**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-27T12:53:02Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-27T12:55:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (verification only)
- **Files modified:** 0

## Accomplishments

- Verified Starlight Seeks Its Form has 6 tracks with unlocksGrowth on 4 tracks
- Verified Finder of Paths Unseen has bidirectional: true and cross-track edge (e3->c3)
- Verified Serpent Slumbering has 3 tracks including Deep Slumber with presenceCap 5-13
- Confirmed typecheck passes with all Node-Edge Graph data

## Task Verification

All tasks were verification-only (no commits needed):

1. **Task 1: Verify Starlight Seeks Its Form** - Already in Node-Edge Graph format
   - 6 rows x 4 cols grid layout
   - unlocksGrowth: true on Energy, CardPlays, Fire/Air, Water/Earth tracks
   - edges: [] (correct - no cross-track connections)

2. **Task 2: Verify Finder of Paths Unseen** - Already in Node-Edge Graph format
   - 2 rows x 6 cols grid layout
   - bidirectional: true (presence can move backwards)
   - Cross-track edge: { from: "e3", to: "c3" }

3. **Task 3: Verify Serpent Slumbering Beneath the Island** - Already in Node-Edge Graph format
   - 3 rows x 9 cols grid layout
   - Energy track (row 0) with Fire elements at slots 3, 5
   - Absorbed Essence track (row 1) with Moon, Earth, Fire elements
   - Deep Slumber track (row 2) with presenceCap: 5-13

## Files Created/Modified

No files modified - all data already correct from 03.4-01.

## Decisions Made

Plan 03.4-01 already performed the conversion of complex spirits when it converted all spirits to Node-Edge Graph format. This plan confirmed the data is correct and complete.

## Deviations from Plan

None - verification confirmed all work already complete.

## Issues Encountered

None - all complex spirits correctly use Node-Edge Graph format.

## Next Phase Readiness

- All spirits (simple and complex) now use Node-Edge Graph format
- Ready for 03.4-07 E2E tests to verify visual rendering
- No blockers or concerns
