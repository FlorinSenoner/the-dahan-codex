# Phase 03.3 Plan 01: Hover-Reveal G1/G2/G3 Labels Summary

**Growth card labels now appear on hover only using Tailwind group-hover pattern for cleaner compact display**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-27T08:57:43Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-27T08:58:36Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- GrowthOptionCard uses Tailwind group-hover pattern
- G1/G2/G3 labels hidden by default, visible on hover
- Labels positioned absolute top-right with z-10
- No visual conflicts with cost badges (which use z-20)
- Growth cards remain functional on touch devices (actions visible, labels supplementary)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update GrowthOptionCard with hover-reveal labels** - `3e2288d` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `app/components/spirits/growth-panel.tsx` - Added group class, moved label to absolute position with hidden group-hover:inline-block

## Decisions Made
- G1/G2/G3 labels use `hidden group-hover:inline-block` for show-on-hover behavior
- Labels positioned `absolute top-1 right-1 z-10` to stay inside card without conflicting with cost badge
- Cost badge z-index increased to z-20 to ensure it appears above label when both present

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Growth panel hover-reveal labels complete
- Ready for subsequent 03.3 plans (if any)
