<objective>
Add support for multiple openings per spirit with tabs UI. Currently only first opening is shown.

Purpose: Allow spirits to have multiple opening strategies (e.g., "Aggressive", "Defensive", "Standard")
Output: Tabs interface for viewing and managing multiple openings

GAP-09 from VERIFICATION.md:
Current implementation only shows `openings[0]`, ignoring additional openings.
Need tabs UI for multiple openings, allow creating additional openings.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Tabs component if not exists</name>
  <files>app/components/ui/tabs.tsx</files>
  <action>
  Check if Tabs component exists. If not, add from shadcn:

  Run: `npx shadcn@latest add tabs`

  This provides:
  - Tabs (root)
  - TabsList
  - TabsTrigger
  - TabsContent

  Skip if component already exists.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Implement multi-opening tabs UI</name>
  <files>app/components/spirits/opening-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
  Refactor OpeningSection to support multiple openings:

  1. Add state for selected opening index:
     ```tsx
     const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);
     ```

  2. Replace single opening logic with tabs:
     - Query returns array of openings
     - Show TabsList with one TabsTrigger per opening
     - Show "+ Add Opening" button in edit mode

  3. UI Structure in read mode (when openings exist):
     ```tsx
     <Tabs value={selectedTab} onValueChange={setSelectedTab}>
       <TabsList>
         {openings.map((opening) => (
           <TabsTrigger key={opening._id} value={opening._id}>
             {opening.name}
           </TabsTrigger>
         ))}
       </TabsList>
       {openings.map((opening) => (
         <TabsContent key={opening._id} value={opening._id}>
           <div className="bg-card border ...">
             {/* Opening display */}
           </div>
         </TabsContent>
       ))}
     </Tabs>
     ```

  4. UI Structure in edit mode:
     - Same tabs but with editable content
     - Add "+ New Opening" button after last tab
     - When creating new, show form inline

  5. State management updates:
     - formData state should track which opening is being edited
     - When creating new opening, add a "new" tab
     - After save, new opening appears in tabs

  Key changes:
  - Replace `const opening = openings?.[0] ?? null` with selected opening logic
  - Update formData initialization to work with selected opening
  - Update save handler to work with selected opening
  - Keep the current form data structure, just track which opening

  Simpler approach for MVP:
  - Use selectedIndex to track which opening
  - formData remains the same structure
  - On tab change, reset formData to that opening's data

1. `pnpm typecheck` passes
2. `pnpm build` succeeds
3. Manual test: Spirit with multiple openings shows tabs
4. Manual test: Clicking tabs switches displayed opening
5. Manual test: In edit mode, can create additional opening
6. Manual test: Each opening can be edited independently

<success_criteria>
- Tabs component available in UI library
- Spirits with multiple openings show all via tabs
- Tab names are opening names
- Can switch between openings by clicking tabs
- In edit mode, can add new opening
- Each opening editable independently
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-text-opening-management/05-14-SUMMARY.md`
