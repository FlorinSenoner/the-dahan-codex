<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Extend SPIRITS config with all 37 spirits</name>
  <files>scripts/scrape-spirits.ts</files>

Update the SPIRITS constant in scripts/scrape-spirits.ts to include all 37 spirits organized by expansion:

Add type for ScrapedSpirit interface that includes:
- name, slug, wikiTitle, imagePattern
- complexity: "Low" | "Moderate" | "High" | "Very High"
- elements: string[]
- summary, description
- strengths: string[], weaknesses: string[]
- powerRatings: { offense, defense, control, fear, utility } (0-5 scale)
- expansion: string (slug form)
- wikiUrl: string

Wiki title patterns:
- Replace spaces with underscores
- Apostrophes encoded as %27
- Example: "Lightning's Swift Strike" -> "Lightning%27s_Swift_Strike"

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add scraping logic for spirit metadata</name>
  <files>scripts/scrape-spirits.ts</files>
  <action>
Update scrapeSpirit function to extract full spirit metadata from wiki pages:

1. **Complexity** - Find in infobox: look for row with "Complexity" label, get text from adjacent cell
   - Map text to literal: "Low", "Moderate", "High", "Very High"

2. **Elements** - Find in infobox: look for element icons or text
   - Parse element names: Sun, Moon, Fire, Air, Water, Earth, Plant, Animal
   - Primary elements are typically 2-3 per spirit

3. **Power Ratings** - Find "Power Summary" template/section
   - Wiki uses bar widths or text: "Low", "Medium-Low", "Medium", "Medium-High", "High"
   - Map to 0-5 scale: Low=1, Medium-Low=2, Medium=3, Medium-High=4, High=5
   - Categories: Offense, Control, Fear, Defense, Utility

4. **Strengths/Weaknesses** - Find "Strategy" section
   - Look for bullet lists under headings containing "strength" or "weakness"
   - If not structured, leave empty arrays (manual fill later)

5. **Summary** - Use spirit's tagline from wiki or generate from first paragraph
   - Keep under 150 characters

6. **Description** - First 2-3 paragraphs from spirit page body
   - Clean HTML to plain text
   - Keep under 500 characters

Add rate limiting: 1 second delay between requests to avoid overloading wiki.

Add error handling: catch and log errors per spirit, continue with others.

  <verify>Run scraper on a single spirit to test: npx tsx scripts/scrape-spirits.ts --test-one</verify>
  <done>scrapeSpirit function extracts complexity, elements, power ratings, summary, description from wiki</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Spirit scraper extended to fetch all 37 spirits with metadata extraction</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run the test command: `npx tsx scripts/scrape-spirits.ts --test-one`
2. Review output for River Surges in Sunlight:
   - Complexity should be "Low"
   - Elements should include Water
   - Power ratings should be numeric 1-5 values
   - Summary/description present

3. If test looks good, run full scrape:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/scrape-spirits.ts
   ```

4. Review scripts/data/spirits.json:
   - Should have 37 spirit objects
   - Spot check a few spirits for accuracy
   - Note any missing data for manual correction later

5. Report any issues:
   - Spirits that failed to scrape
   - Data that looks incorrect
   - Missing fields
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if scraping worked correctly, or describe issues</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. scripts/scrape-spirits.ts compiles without TypeScript errors
2. scripts/data/spirits.json exists with 37 spirit objects
3. All spirits have: name, slug, complexity, elements, powerRatings, summary, wikiUrl
4. Power ratings are numeric 0-5 values
5. No duplicate spirits (unique slugs)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 37 spirits scraped from wiki
- Data saved to JSON for human review before database seeding
- Scraper is repeatable (can re-run to update data)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/08-spirit-aspect-data-scraping/08-01-SUMMARY.md`
