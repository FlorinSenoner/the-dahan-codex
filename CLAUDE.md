# The Dahan Codex

Spirit Island companion PWA with offline-first reference library and game tracker. Includes
text-based turn-by-turn opening guides for spirits.

## Tech Stack

- **TanStack Router** (React 19, TypeScript, file-based routing, client-side SPA)
- **Convex** (real-time backend, cloud-first)
- **Clerk** (authentication)
- **Cloudflare Pages** (deployment)
- **vite-plugin-pwa + Workbox** (PWA service worker, injectManifest strategy)
- **Biome** (linting/formatting - never use Claude for lint work)

## Project Map

```

```bash
pnpm dev              # Dev server (port 4127)
npx convex dev        # Convex dev server (run in parallel)
pnpm build            # Production build (SW generated by vite-plugin-pwa)
pnpm preview          # Preview production build locally
pnpm lint:fix         # Fix lint issues with Biome
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript check
pnpm test:e2e         # Run Playwright tests
pnpm ci               # Full CI: lint, typecheck, build, test
```

## Workflows

**Adding a new route:**

1. Create file in `src/routes/` following TanStack Router conventions
2. Run `pnpm dev` - route tree auto-generates
3. Protected routes go under `_authenticated/` directory

**Adding a Convex function:**

1. Create/edit file in `convex/` (e.g., `convex/spirits.ts`)
2. Import from `convex/_generated/api` in frontend
3. Use `useQuery`/`useMutation` from Convex React

**Running E2E tests locally:**

1. Build app: `pnpm build`
2. Run tests: `pnpm test:e2e`
3. Debug with UI: `pnpm test:e2e:ui`

**Starting a new phase (Auto-Branch):**

GSD commands (`/gsd:plan-phase`, `/gsd:execute-phase`) commit to git automatically. **If on main
when running these commands, automatically create the feature branch** — don't ask the user.

1. **If on main, auto-create branch:**

   ```bash
   # Get phase name from roadmap, create branch automatically
   git checkout -b feat/phase-<number>-<kebab-case-name>
   ```

   Example: `feat/phase-08-spirit-data-scraping`

2. Plan the phase: `/gsd:plan-phase <number>`
3. Execute the phase: `/gsd:execute-phase <number>`

**Completing a phase (MANDATORY - Never skip!):**

After `/gsd:execute-phase` or `/gsd:verify-work` completes, you MUST:

1. Push branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`
2. Create PR: `gh pr create --title "Phase X: Name" --body "..."`
3. Wait for CI: `gh pr checks <number> --watch`
4. **Ask user to verify changes work** - CI passing is not enough. Ask the user to test the affected
   functionality before merging. NEVER merge without user approval.
5. Merge PR (after user approval): `gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch`
6. Verify on main: `git status` should show "On branch main" and "working tree clean"
7. Ready for next phase

**Do NOT stop after verify-work passes.** The phase is not complete until the PR is merged and
you're back on main.

**If you accidentally commit to main:**

```bash
# Create feature branch with your commits
git checkout -b feat/phase-<N>-<name>
# Reset main to origin
git checkout main && git reset --hard origin/main
# Continue work on feature branch
git checkout feat/phase-<N>-<name>
```

## Key Patterns

- Use `useConvexAuth()` for auth state (not Clerk's `useAuth()`)
- Service worker registration is hydration-safe (checks `document.readyState`)
- Pre-commit hooks run Biome + typecheck automatically
- Convex types flow from `schema.ts` → `_generated/` → app
- Always use shadcn `Button` component instead of raw `<button>` elements
  - `Button variant="ghost" size="icon"` for icon-only buttons
  - `Button variant="ghost" size="sm"` for text links/actions
  - `Button variant="outline"` for secondary actions with borders

## Mobile-First with Desktop Support

This is a **mobile-first PWA** designed for use at game tables, but it must also work well on
desktop browsers.

**Interactive elements MUST have:**

- `cursor-pointer` on small interactive elements (buttons, links, icons, toggles)
- Proper hover states (color changes, opacity, etc.)
- Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile accessibility

**Exception — large-surface clickable areas:** List rows, cards, and other large tap targets with
visible `hover:bg-*` states should use `cursor-default`. `cursor-pointer` on large surfaces creates
a "clickbait" feel and adds no value when the hover state already signals interactivity.

**Button component:** `cursor-pointer` is built into the shadcn Button component base styles. No
need to add it manually.

**Non-Button interactive elements** (divs, Links, custom triggers) need `cursor-pointer` added:

```tsx
// Button - cursor-pointer is automatic
<Button>Click me</Button>

// Small interactive elements - add cursor-pointer
<CollapsibleTrigger className="cursor-pointer">Toggle</CollapsibleTrigger>
<Label htmlFor="checkbox" className="cursor-pointer">Click to toggle</Label>

// Large-surface clickable areas - cursor-default is fine with hover states
<div onClick={handleClick} className="hover:bg-muted/50">List row</div>
```

**Why this matters:** Desktop users expect the cursor to change to a pointer when hovering over
small interactive elements. Without this, the UI feels unresponsive and broken.

## Offline-First (CRITICAL)

This is an **offline-first app**. For every new feature, you MUST:

1. **Consider offline behavior during planning** - How does this feature work without internet?
2. **Define the offline strategy** - Does it use cached data? Degrade gracefully? Queue actions?
3. **Handle reconnection** - What happens when connectivity returns? Sync conflicts?

**Common patterns:**

- Static reference data (spirits, cards) → cached via service worker, always available
- User data (game history) → optimistic updates with Convex, queued when offline
- Auth-gated features → show cached data or appropriate offline state

**Never forget:** Users will use this app at game tables without reliable internet.

This app is a pure client-side SPA (switched from TanStack Start SSR in quick-010).

**Implications:**

- No server rendering - all code runs in browser
- Route loaders run client-side (use for prefetching, not data requirements)
- "use client" directives have no effect (Vite + React, not Next.js)
- useSyncExternalStore still needs getServerSnapshot for React 18+ concurrency

**PWA Notes:**

- vite-plugin-pwa with `injectManifest` strategy generates SW from TypeScript (`src/sw.ts`)
- workbox-window manages SW lifecycle (registration, update detection)
- User-prompted updates via UpdateBanner (not silent auto-update)
- PWA components: UpdateBanner, OfflineIndicator, InstallPrompt (in `src/components/pwa/`)
- Convex data cached via TanStack Query + IndexedDB (not SW - WebSocket protocol)
- typeof window checks in PWA hooks are defensive programming, not SSR handling

## E2E Testing

**Regression prevention:**

- After fixing E2E tests, always run the full test suite (`pnpm test:e2e`) to catch regressions.
  Never assume a fix is isolated — changes to shared test utilities can cascade across dozens of
  tests.
- Before modifying shared test helpers or utilities, first `Grep` for all call sites and assess the
  blast radius. List all affected tests before proposing changes.

**Fixing flaky tests:**

- Prefer explicit wait conditions (`waitForSelector`, `waitForResponse`, `page.locator().waitFor()`)
  over `networkidle` or arbitrary timeouts.
- Address strict mode violations by using more specific selectors (e.g., `getByRole` with `name`
  option, `nth()`, or scoped locators) rather than broad queries that match multiple elements.
- When a test is intermittently failing, investigate timing/race conditions before adding waits.
